OptiPuls in Docker
==================

The ``optipuls`` python package is based on the free and open-source `FEniCS`_ computing platform for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The officially recommended way to run FEniCS is by using their `official docker images <https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/>`_.

.. _FEniCS: https://fenicsproject.org/

In view of this, the ``optipuls`` python package comes in a bundle with the official optipuls docker images available at `<https://hub.docker.com/r/optipulsproject/>`_.
